# Hello world

```
function helloWorld() {
	console.log('Hello world');
}
```

Michelle Clifford looked at the minuscule blade in her hands and felt delighted.

She walked over to the window and reflected on her hilly surroundings. She had always loved rural London with its frantic, flabby fields. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel delighted.

Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Beth Thomas. Beth was a cowardly wally with handsome toenails and fragile warts.

Michelle gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was a wild, gracious, cocoa drinker with tall toenails and chubby warts. Her friends saw her as a melted, mute monster. Once, she had even helped a snotacular blind person cross the road.

But not even a wild person who had once helped a snotacular blind person cross the road, was prepared for what Beth had in store today.

The clouds danced like rampaging foxes, making Michelle calm.

As Michelle stepped outside and Beth came closer, she could see the relieved glint in her eye.

Beth gazed with the affection of 3097 noble giant giraffes. She said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want affection."

Michelle looked back, even more calm and still fingering the minuscule blade. "Beth, hands up or I'll shoot," she replied.

They looked at each other with healthy feelings, like two putrid, purple pigeons chatting at a very intuitive dinner party, which had classical music playing in the background and two forgetful uncles jumping to the beat.

Michelle studied Beth's handsome toenails and fragile warts. Eventually, she took a deep breath. "I'm sorry," began Michelle in apologetic tones, "but I don't feel the same way, and I never will. I just don't love you Beth."

Beth looked unstable, her emotions raw like a rapid, rotten ruler.

Michelle could actually hear Beth's emotions shatter into 7548 pieces. Then the cowardly wally hurried away into the distance.

Not even a mug of cocoa would calm Michelle's nerves tonight.
