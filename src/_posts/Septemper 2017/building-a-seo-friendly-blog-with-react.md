```javascript
function helloWorld() {
	console.log('Hello world');
}
```

Simon Bishop had always loved dull New York with its jealous, jittery jungle. It was a place where he felt jumpy.

He was an intuitive, stable, brandy drinker with grubby ankles and spiky eyelashes. His friends saw him as an arrogant, abundant animal. Once, he had even rescued a perfect baby from a burning building. That's the sort of man he was.

Simon walked over to the window and reflected on his sunny surroundings. The drizzle rained like smiling kittens.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of David Gloop. David was a sympathetic author with solid ankles and scrawny eyelashes.

Simon gulped. He was not prepared for David.

As Simon stepped outside and David came closer, he could see the hard glint in his eye.

"Look Simon," growled David, with a hilarious glare that reminded Simon of sympathetic kittens. "It's not that I don't love you, but I want Internet access. You owe me 9591 pounds."

Simon looked back, even more healthy and still fingering the crumpled guillotine. "David, get out of my house," he replied.

They looked at each other with healthy feelings, like two boiling, brainy badgers shouting at a very ruthless funeral, which had jazz music playing in the background and two predatory uncles cooking to the beat.

Suddenly, David lunged forward and tried to punch Simon in the face. Quickly, Simon grabbed the crumpled guillotine and brought it down on David's skull.

David's solid ankles trembled and his scrawny eyelashes wobbled. He looked sneezy, his wallet raw like a rare, round record.

Then he let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later David Gloop was dead.

Simon Bishop went back inside and made himself a nice glass of brandy.
